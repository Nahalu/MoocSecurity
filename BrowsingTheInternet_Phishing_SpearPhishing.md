# Browsing the internet

## Phishing and Spear Phishing

The goal of this part of the MOOC is to make you realize how dangerous it can be to answer a mail you do not know the origin of, and browsing website on internet.
Those fake mails are known as **phishing**, their goals is to collect your data just by clicking on a link sometimes...
However, you do not need to receive a mail to be a victim of a **phishing** when you are visiting a website for the first time which is not **HTTPS**
you do not know if any information you enter on that website is collected (password, mail, adress...), wich is used by hackers to collect more data on you.

The fact that hackers are able to collect that much data on you can create a more dangerous threat, which is known in that case by a **Spear Phishing** attack.
That attack is much more dangerous that the previous one, because, it is nearly impossible to identify it, due to the fact that it had large amount of information on the victim.

Those large amount of information is due to the fact that an hacker has been able to stay for mounths in the mailbox of the victim for exemple.
That threat is not only dangerous for you but can be also for your work if you receive also mail on your personnal mailbox.


Those twoo threat are dangerous and can put you at risk, however there is a way to protect yourself from those. First of, when you are browsing website on the internet,
you need to be sure that the website is secure by having **HTTPS** and not **HTTP**, and be sure what kind of information you are willing to share (mail, password...) most
of the normal users do not change their password wich is very dangerous...
